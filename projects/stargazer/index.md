# Setup and Basic Usage
Stargazer is a Starboard bot for discord it highlights messages in a special channel once they have gained enough ⭐ reactions. In order to set up the bot, you will need to configure two things: the minimum amount of required stars⭐ and the starboard channel

# Minimum Star Requirement
This is the minimum amount of stars⭐ required for a message to be posted into the starboard channel. You can set the minimum star⭐ requirement using:
`*config minStars <number>`

# The Starboard Channel
This is the channel in which all the messages that have met the minimum star⭐ requirement will be posted. It should be a channel normal members can't post in. You can set the starboard channel using: 
`*config channel <channel>`

# How It Works
Now that the bot is set up, it will work without you having to do anything else. Your members can start adding stars⭐ to messages and the bot will highlight them in the starboard channel once a message gains enough stars⭐

# The Star Leaderboard
There is also a star⭐ leaderboard. This shows which user has gotten the most stars overall in the guild. Stars⭐ will be counted, even if a message has not met the minimum star⭐ requirement yet. You can check the leaderboard using:
`*leaderboard`
