# Stargazer Bot - Setup and Basic Usage
In order to set up the bot, you will need to configure two things: the minimum amount of required stars and the starboard channel

# Minimum Star Requirement
This is the minimum amount of stars required for a message to be posted into the starboard channel. You can set the minimum star requirement using:
`*config minStars <number>`

# The Starboard Channel
This is the channel in which all the messages that have met the minimum star requirement will be posted. It should be a channel normal members can't post in. You can set the starboard channel using: 
`*config channel <channel>`
